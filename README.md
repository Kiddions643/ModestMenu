# The best external Mod Menu available

If you don't feel like spending hours grinding for money or just want to protect yourself from God Mode hackers, 
the ***Modest Menu*** is the right choice.
Even if you just want to have a little **more fun** in your converted rocket truck, this is possible. Kiddion's Mod Menu is one of the best external mod menus available for GTA5 on PC/Windows. The Menu supports both Story Mode and Online. It is **widely used and trusted** in the modding community for being **free, undetected and constantly updated**. In addition, the menu can be extended by [community made **scripts**](https://www.kiddionsmodestmenu.com/modest-scripts).

We offer the  **latest, ever-evolving, version** on our [website](https://www.kiddionsmodestmenu.com). You can find all the information about the features of the current version 0.9.8, and their functionality in the [Features section](https://www.kiddionsmodestmenu.com/features) of our Website.
